Materials do not stand alone in development however, they are a result of, or are influenced by, technological needs and developments. The more advanced the material, the more energy and effort is required for its' production. In the US, the production of materials accounts for about 90% of the country's energy usage. This fact clearly indicates a strong tie between materials and energy, and without energy, technological developments based on material advancement will not occur. In our world today, the need to provide improved performance, economics and design in consumer goods comes as a direct result of the market conditions established by consumers. Material selection and design therefore is driven by application and consumer needs which implies that the consumer has a large influence on material consumption. Material selection and material usage in turn have major ecological implications in energy, material resources and direct environmental impact.

On a more pragmatic level, our world of ever-increasing technological complexity demands that everyone is to some extent familiar with things technical. William A. Wulf, President of the National Academy of Engineering, has said that a public that is technologically less than literate and unable to understand technical decisions is left to trust that good decisions will be made on their behalf. We invite you to take this course to get a feeling for what engineers experience in their work and bring out the creativity in each of you. The goal of this course is to help Carnegie Mellon students of all disciplines understand the role and impact of engineering in modern society and participate in the excitement of engineering. Demonstrations and hands-on projects will give students the experience of what engineers do. After completing this course you will have a better understanding of the contributions of engineering to our society, how engineers see and think about the world, what the \"big issues\" for engineers are, what's involved in the different fields of engineering, and the tools engineers use.

The past twenty years have seen dramatic changes in innovation ecosystems in the U.S. and internationally. Alone within the U.S., there has been a sharp decline in corporate R&D labs, matched by the global fragmentation of firm activities. At the same time growing linkages have been observed across institutional firms, government labs, and universities and national borders. These changes raise critical questions about the new rules of the game driving technological change in the 21st century. This course sheds insights into these questions through the lenses of competing economic, sociological, and political science theories on the structures supporting technological change. The course is broken into three sections. The first section introduces students to theories of the firm, bureaucracy, institutional economics, and social networks as competing frameworks within which to understand technological change. The second section presents the contemporary literature on the technological change, including creative destruction, dominate designs, industry life cycles, and networks of innovators. The concluding section leverages lessons from the preceding two sections to evaluate national innovation systems, and the factors that lead to national comparative advantage. Students should leave the class able to reflect competently on what the existing literature tells us about the factors influencing global technology competitiveness, and on how modern changes in the structures supporting innovation as well as technology itself may be changing the rules of the game for firms and for nations.

Existing fuel cell applications range from the small scale, such as portable cell phone chargers, to the large scale, such as MW-scale power plants. Depending on the application, fuel cell systems offer unique advantages and disadvantages compared with competing technologies. For vehicle applications, they offer efficiency and environmental advantages compared with traditional combustion engines. In the first half of the course, the focus is on understanding the thermodynamics and electrochemistry of the various types of fuel cells, such as calculating the open circuit voltage and the sources of voltage loss due to irreversible processes for the main fuel cells types: PEM/SOFC/MCFC. The design and operation of several real fuel cells are then compared against this theoretical background. The second half of the course focuses on the balance-of-plant requirements of fuel cell systems, such as heat exchangers, pumps, fuel processors, compressors, as well as focusing on capital cost estimating. Applying the material learned from the first and second halves of the class into a final project, students will complete an energy & economic analysis of a fuel cell system of their choice.

Nowadays images of the self and others, prompt viewers to consider a wide range of psychological, spiritual, & political information beyond visual manifestation. Two basic questions \"Who are you?\" & \"What is art?\" often come together in the contemporary portrait.

The binding projects will be: A hardcover for a paper back book, a single signature book, a multi-signature book with flat spine, and a box construction. The box project is designed and crafted to contain a small letterpress printed class edition, either in book form, or as a set of un-bound pages. The letterpress component teaches the standard issues, unique to the relief process, in press work, handset procedure of cast metal type, page form spacing, lock-up of pages in press, proofing, and production printing.

In this course, we will survey this trajectory by viewing and analyzing eight repertory staples: Wagner Parsifal Debussy Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande Puccini Turandot Berg Wozzeck Gershwin Porgy and Bess Britten Peter Grimes Messiaen Saint Fran\u00e7ois d'Assise Reich Three Tales We will also become acquainted with other works related to these staples, from Strauss to Saariaho and Tan Dun, and ask numerous questions.

How have audiences changed? How has the notion of opera itself changed, from the nature of its heroes and heroines to its performance forces and media? The goals of this course are to 1) promote intimate knowledge of the eight core operas; 2) encourage familiarity with numerous related opera plots, opera composers, and twentieth- and twenty-first-century musical styles; 3) broaden literary and musical analytical tools to include historical, aesthetic, and (multi)cultural perspectives on opera; and 4) improve oral and written communication skills about opera.

Spring 2012: Women writers played an essential role in the construction of Victorian literary culture. In this course we will read novels, poems, and periodical extracts by a diverse body of nineteenth-century female authors as a means of better understanding women's historic and aesthetic impact on Victorian culture. While some of our authors are well known, like the wildly popular poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning, we will also encounter the 'lost' author, journalist, and controversial anti-feminist Eliza Lynn Linton. The writing of Victorian women exemplifies important social debates from the nineteenth-century. Social taboos such as divorce, suffrage, Bloomerism, children out of wedlock, and women in the workforce were all topical in Victorian culture. As the conflicted and introspective heroine of George Eliot's The Mill on the Floss reminds readers, the role of marriage as a woman's sole profession was becoming increasingly untenable in the modern era. Victorians were forced to ask what other function were women fit to occupy. From the Pre-Raphaelite poetry of Christina Rossetti, to the gothic horror of Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights, \"the woman question\" served as a lightening rod for a variety of nineteenth-century cultural anxieties. The woman as deviant and criminal which we will encounter in Mary Elizabeth Braddon's Lady Audley's Secret was an especially controversial aspect of the female-dominated genre of \"Sensation Fiction.\" Margaret Oliphant records in an 1867 review from Blackwoods: \"What is held up to us as the story of the feminine soul as it really exists underneath its conventional coverings is a very fleshy and unlovely record.(See Dept. for full desc.).", "title": "19th Century British Literature", "corequirements": "", "created_at": "2015-03-24 02:24:18.641758", "updated_at": "2015-03-24 02:24:18.641762", "units": 9.0, "fallsemester": false, "department": 76, "summersemester": false, "id": 76213}, "model": "course.Course"}, {"fields": {"prerequirements": "76-101", "springsemester": false, "description": "Topics vary by semester.

Given America's current obsession with youth culture, it's hard to imagine a time when the word \"teenager\" did not exist. However, this word came into being largely as a result of the post World War II boom in consumerism when advertisers needed a new way to define an emerging demographic group with its own disposable income and spending power. Through a survey of twentieth century literature that focuses on the teenage experience, we'll explore the changing meanings of young adulthood over the last one hundred years. What is the relationship between the invention of the teenager and modernist aesthetics? What characteristics were considered markers of young adulthood in the 1920's? In the 1950's? In 2000? How are the experiences of angst, anomie and the unfulfilled American dream connected to modern Western life through the teenage subject? How do tropes of individualism, rebellion, freedom and resistance connect the literature of teen angst with other genres of American literature? How has teen angst been both an impediment to and the inspiration for cultural resistance and social change? To answer these questions, we will compare texts such as Philip Roth's Portnoy's Complaint, Anzia Yezierska's The Bread Givers, J.D.

Spring 2014: For decades, communication researchers relying on stimulus-response theories associated a text with a single dominant stimulus evoking a single dominant response. This thinking widely influenced rhetorical understandings of language for decades as well. Today, rhetorical theories of language have discredited these behaviorist theories in favor of theories that see language as the constructors of situations rather than the effects of them. When speakers and writers use language, they resuscitate, enact, and perform worlds of experience from words. They create not only meanings but histories, identities, and social bids to initiate social change. This course introduces students to a theory and ontology of language study that is in keeping with language as a constructive activity. Students will learn to use software designed to analyze texts qualitatively and numerically from a constructive point of view. The software works as a microscope to help you see patterns of language use that escape the limited attention span of even the most painstaking of close readers. After learning how the software works, we will do exercises with small textual samples so that students can sharpen their powers of observing language across families of patterns. Students are encouraged to analyze the texts they love most -- from literature, politics, journalism, to their favorite blog posts, tweets, and Facebook posts.

Spring 2014. Beginning with Aristotle?s definition of rhetoric as the faculty of observing the available means of persuasion in a given case, rhetoric has been closely associated with cases. Like Aristotle, during the past century rhetorical theorists including Kenneth Burke, Chaim Perelman, Stephen Toulmin, and Thomas Sloane have remarked on the close affinity between the rhetorical method and the casuistical one?based on analogical reasoning from paradigmatic past cases?and some have even proposed that we model a theory of argument on the case-based reasoning found in Anglo-American legal systems. In this course, we?ll explore the casuistical or case-based method of argument commonly used in law, business, and public policy schools and in various moral and ethical contexts including medical and bioethics, as well as the case study research methodology frequently used in the social sciences and practice-oriented disciplines such as law, business, and education. Alongside various examples of cases and case-based arguments, we?ll read rhetorical and interdisciplinary scholarship discussing the casuistical method, the relationship cases bear to general rules, theories, and principles, the role of ideology and narrative in case construction, and claims that case studies are invaluable for their ability to represent the unique qualities of a person, group, or situation.

Frank Norris's grisly tale of an overbearing dentist and his miserly wife, McTeague, Andrew Carnegie's autobiography, Upton Sinclair's iconic The Jungle, Edith Wharton's tragic love story House of Mirth, Charlotte Perkins Gilman's feminist utopian novel, Herland, William Dean Howell's capitalist satire, The Rise of Silas Lapham, Theodor Drieser's mournful Sister Carrie-all of these writings react to, and try to shape, the economy of a century ago. These novels, which were often critical of corporate capitalism, give us a rich and detailed picture of the last time in the US that Americans suffered under the kind of gap we have today between rich and poor. In the US today the top 1% controls 42% of the country's wealth, while the bottom 80% controls a mere 7% of the country's wealth.

While the course readings will be comprised primarily of theoretical and historical approaches to media, we will also draw off many primary sources such as science-fiction, classics of American literature from writers such as Walt Whitman and Thomas Pynchon, as well as documents in which technical pioneers such as Alan Turing outline the form and function of concepts and devices that directly shape modern day computing.

Today they can be visited in relative comfort by tourists. But as the world has grown smaller, our sense of adventure and exoticism has changed. That change can clearly be seen by examining the ways in which film has dealt with ?the exotic? over the last century. Early films of stories such as H. Rider Haggard?s She (first filmed in 1911) and Edgar Rice Burrough?s Tarzan of the Apes (first filmed in 1918) have been remade at regular intervals up to the present, with each iteration displaying differences that reflect the social, racial and political constructs of their times. The same pattern can be seen in film documentaries which progress from the fictionalization of exploration and adventure in films like Chang, Gow the Headhunter and Nanook of the North, to the arguably no less fictionalized accounts of March of the Penguins and the ?Disney Nature? documentaries. In our examination of ways the concepts of exoticism and adventure have changed, we will also discuss events in the film industry which have impacted perceptions in the West. The post-war internationalization of film culture, for example, reduced or channeled the ?otherness? of locales with thriving industries, while the rise of a globalized market has led Hollywood to de-emphasize or simplify cultural differences. At the same time, cultural sensitivities have tempered the once common lionization of explorers and adventurers. Lastly, we will consider the significance of the shift from exploration narratives set in remote parts of the Earth to science fiction stories which take place on exotic worlds beyond our own, as Hollywood attempts to adapt established models to new cultural imperatives.

What does the medium in which a text is presented?the book, or film, or painting, or theatrical performance?have to do with how the text is received, consumed, contested, or appropriated, sometimes or often against the intentions of the author, painter, or performer? \\tThis course studies the long-debated problem of how readers or spectators respond to texts (in print, film, theater or painting) from ancient rhetoric and tragedy to contemporary mass culture. Aristotle, Plato, Longinus and other ancients theorized about audience response in terms of its danger or advantage to the polis; in that broad sense, the problem has always been political as well as psychological and aesthetic. Eighteenth-century thinkers formulated notions of ?beauty? and ?standards of taste? to measure audience response to poetry and visual art. Romantic writers developed psychologies of reading as symbolic interpretation. The rise of mass culture, on the other hand, links the politics of reading or viewing to questions of consumption and the market of cultural goods.

With his collaborator Ford Madox Ford, Joseph Conrad developed the technique known as impressionism, a style intended above all, as he said, to make us see. He is known for the complexity of his narratives and his formal experiments. James Joyce is regarded as having perfected all of the formal possibilities of the novel, effectively exhausting the form.

It is a commonplace to assume that literature has a message, but it is still not at all clear just how an imaginative representation of the world does, or can, communicate. Booth had particular difficulty understanding how fiction could communicate a felt sense of life and value when there was doubt about narrative authority, or the 'reliability' of the author. So, postmodern fiction (from Joyce on) caused him problems. In an attempt to develop a postmodern rhetoric of fiction we shall be looking at texts that deal directly with issues of persuasion, or texts that seem directly to address the reader. Of particular interest will be texts that indirectly implicate the reader, and achieve a kind of implicit rhetoric even when they apparently frustrate normal expectations of communicative language (e.g. the apparent fact that the reader is also a character in Calvino's 'novel' if on a winters' night\\205). We'll consider the kinds of problems (and solutions to those problems) caused by excessive irony, by 'showing' rather than 'telling' and by the 'absent author,' in texts like Madame Bovary, Notes From Underground, Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, etc. Course Website: http://www.cmu.edu/hss/english/courses/courses.html", "title": "Rhetoric of Fiction", "corequirements": "", "created_at": "2015-03-24 02:24:18.642635", "updated_at": "2015-03-24 02:24:18.642638", "units": 9.0, "fallsemester": false, "department": 76, "summersemester": false, "id": 76377}, "model": "course.Course"}, {"fields": {"prerequirements": "76-101", "springsemester": false, "description": "Literacy has been called the engine of economic development, the road to social advancement, and the prerequisite for critical abstract thought.

In the first half of the course we look at writers and designers as thinkers and problem solvers-facing the challenge of equally creative, meaning-making readers and their own constructive, interpretive processes of comprehension. Understanding (and user-testing for) how readers actually interpret texts is critical to many kinds of writing, from informative websites and PR work, to persuasive applications and powerful arguments. An introduction to the research and theory on reading and writing as a social/cognitive process lets us explore the why behind the what readers do. For instance, you will learn how memory networks, cognitive schemas, and meta-knowledge can shape and are shaped by language and discourse as socially constructed mediating tools. At the same time you will develop a portfolio of methods that track the constructive, inferential process of readers' comprehension.

In some cases, these phenomena have sparked the public's imagination and their promise has stirred their confidence in a better future. In other cases, they have kindled fears and generated protests over the risks of new technologies and the threats of novel scientific ideas to prevailing social, cultural, economic, and political orders. This course examines the complex dynamics in the relationships between science, technology, and society. Towards this end it engages with questions such as: How do we decide who an expert is? To what extent do scientists have an obligation to consider the social and ethical consequences of their work? Is public education about science and technology sufficient for addressing social concerns about risk and controversial scientific ideas? We will grapple with these and other questions by exploring modern public debates in which science, technology, and society play a primary role such as the AIDS crisis, global warming, and the autism vaccine debate. With the help of analytical theories from sociology, rhetoric, and public policy, we will develop a general framework for thinking about argument and the dynamics of the relationship between science, technology and the public.

Hawks is probably best remembered for romantic comedies such as His Girl Friday and Bringing Up Baby, and for a pair of films he made in the 1940s with Humphrey Bogart, To Have and Have Not and The Big Sleep. But, he also made war pictures (Dawn Patrol), action-adventure stories (Only Angels Have Wings), musicals (Gentlemen Prefer Blonds), Westerns (Red River), one of the great gangster films, the original Scarface, and even Biblical epic. He is often credited as the auteur of sci-fi movie he produced.

We will read scholarship in this still-emerging field to orient you to its key issues, practical and methodological problems, and theoretical implications: work by Roger Chartier, Michel Foucault, Elizabeth Eisenstein, Pierre Bourdieu, Michel de Certeau, Adrian Johns, and others.

We will study the relation between the aesthetic powers of the ?text? and the material pleasures of the ?book?; the emergence of a modern, imaginative category of ?literature? in conjunction with the consolidating power of the novel.

As the above quote from Maurois suggests, we will take a broad view of the concept of ?argument? and examine its role as a discursive means of truth seeking, knowledge creation, and decision-making, not just as the practice of using language to justify or refute a conclusion. The goal of the seminar is for participants to acquire the concepts needed to read the current research/scholarship on argumentation with understanding, to apply that research to the analysis of arguments, and to be positioned to contribute to that research. We will begin with a brief history of the classical Greek writings on logic, rhetoric and dialectic, especially the writings of Aristotle. There are questions from that tradition that endure to this day: What does it take for a conclusion to be well supported? What criteria should govern acceptance of a conclusion? We will also examine two landmarks in the contemporary study of argumentation, Perelman and Olbrects-Tyteca?s The New Rhetoric and Toulmin?s The Uses of Arguments, both published in 1958.

Richard Wagner's music drama Tristan und Isolde and his theoretical essays, including \"Art and Revolution\" and \"The Art-Work of the Future,\" further illustrate and develop the theme, showing how a dominant representative of nineteenth century culture sought to reevaluate and reclaim the tragic form, linking it with an extensive critique of modern culture. Thomas Mann's Death in Venice provides an early twentieth century variation on the theme of tragedy, and Sigmund Freud's Civilization and its Discontents, like Nietzsche's essay, provides a framework for placing tragedy in its cultural context. Finally, Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman provides a modern American version of the problem of tragedy.

Thus we will explore questions like: What is Chinese culture in the modern world? What is \"modern\" and what \"traditional\" Chinese culture? How does high culture interact with folk culture and popular culture? How have education and language policies shaped Chinese cultural identities over the last century? What does it mean to be Chinese in a diaspora context?

These periods include: the conquest and colonization, the independence and constitution of nation-states, the inter war period and the depression, the 1970?s and the military dictatorships and the present globalization stage. However, it is important to point out that there is no suggestion of continuity or unique experience that represents the diverse groups and societies that constitute Latin America. These phases in the development of a Latin American cultural identity represent the existence of certain dominant discourses and certain controversies that are important in understanding Latin American culture (Larra\u00edn 1996). The idea is to explore how Latin America imagines itself and constructs a narrative about its origins and development. There are three main questions we will be exploring through out the course: Where does the discussion about Latin America emerge from?, How does Latin America think of itself?, What does Latin America want to be?. These questions will be explored historically through readings of philosophical and political texts that deal with Latin American identity as well as with literary texts, films and music that represent practices that enact this/ese identity/ies.

For example, Gauss gave a detailed analysis of the integers that can be represented by a given quadratic form, and Abel and Galois showed that the general quintic equation has no solution by radicals.

The prevailing standard model of linguistic interpretation traces back to the work of Paul Grice. On Grice's model, the interpretation of a linguistic utterance is a two stage process. First, an interpreter calculates the meaning of the sentence uttered on the basis of the conventional meanings of the words and syntactic constructions used. The output of this compositional process is assumed to be a proposition. Then, the interpreter proceeds to make inferences, based on this proposition and other contextual information, as to what the speaker meant. Crucially, this process (a) treats the truth conditional content of sentences as compositionally determinable on the basis of purely linguistic information and (b) clearly separates the contribution of semantic processes and pragmatic (inferential) ones. This standard picture has been critiqued from a variety of perspectives, and there is an ongoing debate surrounding the theory of the construction of meaning. Some philosophers and linguists have argued that inferential processes indeed do contribute to the determination of truth conditional content, or \"what is said.\" Others defend some version of the standard view, and have provided a variety of responses to critiques. Both kinds of view come in different degrees, ranging from extreme contextualists to those who deny that naive intuitions about utterance interpretation provide insight into the acutal meanings of sentences.

Alone within the U.S., there has been a sharp decline in corporate R&D labs, matched by the global fragmentation of firm activities. At the same time growing linkages have been observed across institutional firms, government labs, and universities and national borders. These changes raise critical questions about the new rules of the game driving technological change in the 21st century. This course sheds insights into these questions through the lenses of competing economic, sociological, and political science theories on the structures supporting technological change. The course is broken into three sections. The first section introduces students to theories of the firm, bureaucracy, institutional economics, and social networks as competing frameworks within which to understand technological change. The second section presents the contemporary literature on the technological change, including creative destruction, dominate designs, industry life cycles, and networks of innovators. The concluding section leverages lessons from the preceding two sections to evaluate national innovation systems, and the factors that lead to national comparative advantage. Students should leave the class able to reflect competently on what the existing literature tells us about the factors influencing global technology competitiveness, and on how modern changes in the structures supporting innovation as well as technology itself may be changing the rules of the game for firms and for nations.

In addition, students meet once a week with the CMU internship faculty - sometimes as a group and sometimes one-on-one -- to report and reflect on their internship experiences. The internship and weekly internship meeting require approximately 27-28 hours per week. Students earn 15 CMU units of credit for the internship and internship seminar.

This thematic research seminar will explore the workings of Congress - the first branch under the Constitution - and its role in making public policy. It combines coursework with the original scholarship requirements of a UCDC research seminar and is designed particularly for students in Congressional internships and those considering Congressional staff positions after graduation. This seminar will take advantage of our Washington location by featuring frequent guest speakers and seeking connections to current policy and political debate. In addition to studying the pathways of lawmaking, we will ask how Congress and its Members relate to the other branches of government, the press, and the public. Topics to be examined include the rules and organization of Capitol Hill, campaign finance, redistricting, lawmaking and the House and Senate rules, budget process and politics, executive oversight, judicial nominations, lobbyists and influence, and policy entrepreneurialism. Seminar requirements in addition to the internship include preparation and in-class participation, a substantial research brief and several applied writing assignments related to a policy that currently is or should be before Congress.

Over the years, this course has canvassed the Washington theater scene and discovered a wealth of politically and socially attuned material on DC stages. Washington has, rather surprisingly, emerged as the second most vibrant theatrical city in the nation, surpassing Chicago and Los Angeles in number of performances offered, audience in attendance, and union actors appearing in Equity-contracted productions. The city now boasts some of the finest classical flagship and culturally specific theaters in the country. This advent of a robust theater scene planted in the seat of power has created a unique cultural profile; that of an artistic force able to speak truth to power. Yet oftentimes, theatrical institutions are constricted by the divided nature of the audience they play for, or the critical community that critiques them, or differing notions about the purpose of theater. What kind of portraits are emerging from area theaters in this politicized capital? What are the practical politics within these institutions that seek to engage and entertain their patrons?

Social psychologists investigate how subjects segment a stream of activity and social historians grudgingly readmit events into the schemas of historiography (or decline to do so).

Questions we will consider as well as looking at looking at the current public policy responses to them are: Why are some countries rich and some are poor? Why have some countries experienced rapid economic development; what can be done to foster development of others that continue to languish?

This course will begin with economic and political theory on why these differences over time and across countries may exist. Then it will survey some of these differences across both industrialized and pre-industrial societies and investigate their causes and consequences. Some of the questions the course will ask include the following: In the industrialized world, the public sector (government) plays a much larger role in Europe than in the United States. Why is this so? How does this affect the quality of everyday life for different classes of people? How have globalization and technological change affected the distribution of income and social policy in industrialized countries, and how does this affect the public sector? In some tribal societies, people have no access to markets at all. How does this affect distributive behavior within communities? Finally, what might be the ultimate causes of income inequality on a global scale? Are there prehistoric and environmental roots in the ways peoples of different societies live today? This course will examine these questions by studying theoretical and empirical research conducted by economists, economic anthropologists, political economists, and economic geographers on these questions.

In exploring why we care about education, we examine the private returns to education (those that accrue to the individual) and the social returns (those that accrue to society), and how social returns provide one rationalization for government's involvement in education. After an overview of basic facts related to the provision of elementary and secondary education in the United States, we turn to the issue of how education is produced. We study the role of financial resources, teachers and peers in the production process, and examine evidence on the effectiveness of public vs. private schools. In the face of evidence that public schools in the United States do not fare well in international comparisons, one response has been to give parents greater choice of schools for their children. This leads us to study the most prevalent school choice mechanism (choosing where to live), as well as charter schools and private school vouchers. Another response has been the movement to hold public schools accountable, of which the No Child Left Behind legislation is an example. Thus, we examine issues on accountability theory and practice. The concern remains, however, that even if elementary and secondary education were significantly improved through various mechanisms, the cognitive ability of some children would already lag behind by the time they start school due to their early childhood experiences. In this spirit we analyze evidence on early childhood interventions for disadvantaged children. Building on our understanding of educational outcomes through high school, we finalize with an overview of the market for higher education, with an emphasis on college pricing and admission decisions. Throughout we use microeconomic analytical tools, and we examine empirical evidence that applies econometric techniques.

Designing algorithms to control CPSs, such as those in cars, aircraft and robots, is challenging due to their tight coupling with physical behavior. At the same time, it is vital that these algorithms be correct, since we rely on CPSs for safety-critical tasks like keeping aircraft from colliding. Students in this course will understand the core principles behind CPSs, develop models and controls, identify safety specifications and critical properties of CPSs, understand abstraction and system architectures, learn how to design by invariant, reason rigorously about CPS models, verify CPS models of appropriate scale, understand the semantics of a CPS model and develop an intuition for operational effects. Students will write hybrid programs (HPs), which capture relevant dynamical aspects of CPSs in a simple programming language with a simple semantics, allowing the programmer to refer to real-valued variables representing real quantities and specify their dynamics as part of the HP.

Astonishingly, in spite of this tremendous change in hardware technology over time, a small core set of techniques for building distributed systems has emerged and remained surprisingly stable and applicable across many system layers. Many flavors of these techniques exist, and they continously evolve over time to reflect changing trade-offs in the design space. What are these core techniques, and how can we leverage them in creating distributed systems today and in the future? That is the central question addressed by this course. Students will acquire the knowledge base, intellectual tools, hands-on skills and modes of thought needed to build well-engineered distributed systems that withstand the test of time, growth in scale, and stresses of live use. Strong design and implementation skills are expected of all students. The course assumes a high level of proficiency in all aspects of operating system design and implementation. A substantial project component is an integral part of the course. Please refer to http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-grad/courseschedules14.html this link for the most recent schedule updates.

Why is this so? How does this affect the quality of everyday life for different classes of people? How have globalization and technological change affected the distribution of income and social policy in industrialized countries, and how does this affect the public sector? In some tribal societies, people have no access to markets at all. How does this affect distributive behavior within communities? Finally, what might be the ultimate causes of income inequality on a global scale? Are there prehistoric and environmental roots in the ways peoples of different societies live today?

In exploring why we care about education, we examine the private returns to education (those that accrue to the individual) and the social returns (those that accrue to society), and how social returns provide one rationalization for government's involvement in education. After an overview of basic facts related to the provision of elementary and secondary education in the United States, we turn to the issue of how education is produced. We study the role of financial resources, teachers and peers in the production process, and examine evidence on the effectiveness of public vs. private schools. In the face of evidence that public schools in the United States do not fare well in international comparisons, one response has been to give parents greater choice of schools for their children. This leads us to study the most prevalent school choice mechanism (choosing where to live), as well as charter schools and private school vouchers. Another response has been the movement to hold public schools accountable, of which the No Child Left Behind legislation is an example. Thus, we examine issues on accountability theory and practice. The concern remains, however, that even if elementary and secondary education were significantly improved through various mechanisms, the cognitive ability of some children would already lag behind by the time they start school due to their early childhood experiences. In this spirit we analyze evidence on early childhood interventions for disadvantaged children. Building on our understanding of educational outcomes through high school, we finalize with an overview of the market for higher education, with an emphasis on college pricing and admission decisions. Throughout we use microeconomic analytical tools, and we examine empirical evidence that applies econometric techniques.

A failure to understand the historical evolution of economic institutions or the variety of past economic experience is perhaps the worst shortcoming of many economists. The study of economic history provides an opportunity to test currently fashionable theories against data different from those used in their construction. In fact, this is a course in applied economics. The theories developed in the intermediate courses will be applied to episodes from the past in ways that increase understanding both of the specific historical episodes considered and the economic theories employed.
